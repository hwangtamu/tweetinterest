For Perkins, a Modest Addition to a Full Coaching R?sum?
ELLISVILLE, Miss. -- Ray Perkins held two of the most high-profile jobs a football coach can occupy. From 1979 to 1982, he was the coach for the Giants, and in 1983, he was chosen to succeed Bear Bryant at Alabama. Add a stint with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers , and it would be fair to expect that Perkins would now be kicking back in a chair, enjoying

Jets Trade Hunter to the Rams
Wayne Hunter's time with the Jets was tumultuous. It was exasperating. It is also over. Four days after benching him, the Jets traded Hunter to the St. Louis Rams on Monday night in what could be described as a classic change-of-scenery trade. Out goes one underperforming right tackle and in comes another, Jason Smith, who lost his starting job a

The moves coincided with the Seahawks ' deeming Jackson expendable after

Jets Trim a Bright Spot From a Dismal Offense
Most teams that score precisely 21 points do so the conventional way, by taking the football and crossing the goal line three times. But the Jets , as has been widely established, are not most teams. To tally their 21 points over three games, fewest so far in the N.F.L. this preseason, the Jets have booted seven field goals, spicing up a fierce

A Giant Used to Starting Over Finally Gets a Shot at Starting
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Giants cornerback Michael Coe searched his vocabulary for the words to describe how he has approached a six-year N.F.L. career that has included three teams and shoulder and knee surgeries but not -- until now -- an opportunity to become a starter. Finally, he made one up. ''I learned how to re-humble myself,'' said Coe,

Ryan is aware of the team's widening division. His hope is that eventually it will develop a balance. But the Jets' reality -- after three preseason

Giants Are Left Thin at Cornerback
The Giants thought they were fortunate when the all-American cornerback Prince Amukamara, projected as a top-10 selection, fell to them with the 19th overall pick in last year's draft.
