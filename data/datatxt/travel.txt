EXPLORER; Into Thin Air, True Believers
I STOPPED, again, to catch my breath in the thin Andean air, struggling to ease the dizziness as I inhaled from a portable oxygen tank. I must have been a curious sight to the Peruvians passing by. My friends, Andray and Louise, stood beside me, concerned. Realizing we were blocking pedestrian traffic, I pressed myself into the side of the mountain

FRUGAL TRAVELER; Fiji for The Rest Of Us
I LIKE backpackers as individuals and tolerate them in small groups, but this crowd terrified me. They were lining up for a bright yellow catamaran called the Yasawa Flyer to speed from Fiji's main island to some of its tiniest and most idyllic. And I was with them, worried I was about to spend my five precious days in paradise on a spring

HEADS UP; Seattle Looks Back 50 Years
ON a recent morning, as wind and spitting rain lashed the Space Needle's observation deck, the Seattle writer Knute Berger described the World's Fair that opened far below, in Seattle Center, 50 years ago last month. ''The 1962 fair was a vision of the future, with the Space Needle, the Monorail, and pavilions devoted to a 'Century 21' theme,''

SURFACING; San Francisco's NoPa: A Leafier, Low-Key Mission
YEARS ago, realtors attempted to gussy up a gritty slice of the Western Addition area of San Francisco -- home to wig shops, greasy diners and its fair share of crime -- with a catchy acronym, NoPa, after its city-central location, north of the Panhandle. When the restaurant Nopa took over an abandoned Laundromat in 2006, the moniker started to

A Tourist in My Son's New Home
I THOUGHT it was hard when my sons went away to college. That fearfully empty nest. Everyone else can go right ahead and be chipper about all the newfound free time. About how nice it is not to have to wake up at 2 in the morning to see if high school curfews have been met. Frankly, that was a piece of cake compared with the difficulty of knowing
